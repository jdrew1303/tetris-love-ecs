# tetris-love-ecs

This is a Tetris clone built using an ECS architecture. It provides mostly classic Tetris gameplay, with the added features of:

* Hold a piece
* Random bag for the pieces
* Ability to see 5 pieces ahead.



Developed in lua using the [love2d](https://love2d.org) framework. 

The ECS library is [Concord](https://github.com/Tjakka5/Concord/).

This was done to experiment with ECS
